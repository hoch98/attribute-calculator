kuudra gang bot and coflnet mod has this function, but its locked behind a paywall, so i built my own

onlyShards.py is for only using attribute shards to calculate

includeArmour.py uses both attributes and armour

getArmour.py is for dual attribute calculating

tryout.py uses an api I coded, so might not work all the time

discordBot.py is a discord bot that uses the new api

the rest is for https://hoch98.github.io/attribute-calculator/
