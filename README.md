kuudra gang bot and coflnet mod has this calculator, but its locked behind a paywall, so i built my own

`onlyShards.py` only using attribute shards to calculate

`includeArmour.py` uses both attributes and armour

`getArmour.py` is for dual attribute calculating, also goes finds which armour auction to buy to be cheapest

`tryout.py` uses an api I coded, so might not work in a month

`discordBot.py` is a discord bot that uses the new api

the rest is for https://hoch98.github.io/attribute-calculator/
